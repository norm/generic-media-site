Generic Media Site
==================

As part of an internal Yahoo! Hack Day, a team of web developers created a 
proof-of-concept for using the r3 tool (http://developer.yahoo.com/r3/) to 
build multiple websites from a generic site core.

This is a replication of that project, serving as an illustration of
the capabilities of r3.
